2. We have trained the model in main.ipynb file build upon Xception Architecture consisting of various layers being build as separable convolutional neural network layer.
3. Download the datasets from here [training-dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G71lhOIe2qn6Qrd2VAOllMi-Kf2GzWGl/view?usp=sharing) and [testing-dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nd_cpjDWptgz8y_be9hwmjGTO5Dlhc5k/view?usp=sharing)
